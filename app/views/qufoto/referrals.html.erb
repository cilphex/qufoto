<h1>Refer friends, get paid</h1>

<p>Yep, you can earn money from Qufoto!  And it's dead simple.  All you need to do is
<a href="/contact">send us a short note</a> letting us know that you have referred someone
who is about to sign up, or who just recently signed up.  If/when that person signs up, 
we'll send you one month's worth of cold, hard (digital) cash to your PayPal account.</p>

<p>The idea is that you get one free month of service for anyone you recommend who signs up,
but you can make a profit!  Since we actually send you money and not just skip one of your
monthly subscription payments, the amount you can make is only limited by the number of people
you can refer.</p>

<p>So, onward!  Spread the good news!  Make some cash!</p>
